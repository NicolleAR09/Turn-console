### Turn console 
Software that works like a pharmacy’s turntable (machine that is located at the entrance of many shops or banks, which asks you what procedure you come to perform and assigns you a shift number according to the area you want to address). 
In this case, it is the tunnel for a pharmacy that has three areas of care: 
perfumery, pharmacy (which is where they sell drugs), and cosmetics. 

The program asks the client which area he wants to go to, and will give him a number according to which area he is going to. For example, if you choose cosmetics you will get the number C-54 ("C" for cosmetics). 

After that, he’s going to ask if we want to take another shift. This, in 
Actually, it’s to simulate if a new client comes. And it will repeat the whole process.
